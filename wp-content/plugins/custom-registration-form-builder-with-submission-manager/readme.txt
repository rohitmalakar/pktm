Simple yet powerful custom registration form builder that allows you to create unlimited customized registration and contact forms.

== Description ==

Custom User Registration Form Builder is an easy to use form creating system that allows you to create any type of forms with few simple clicks. We have put focus squarely on ease of use, since we thought almost all other form plugins throws loads of features right on users’ screens when all they need is a quick and intuitive form creation and management process. 

As soon as you activate the plugin and go to “Custom Registration Form” link in the left menu, you see our elegant forms manager to manager all your WordPress forms. When you fist visit the page, forms area will be empty and you will see “Add New” button on top bar to start creating WordPress forms. When you click it, you will be taken to a new page with following fields:

= Type: = Radio box for deciding if the form will be a normal contact form or Registration form to allow visitors to register as users on your WordPress site. Registration form will already have mandatory username and password fields, while contact form will require all fields to be added from forms manager page.

Note - Password field will not appear if you chose “Auto Generate Password” in Global Settings.

= Unique Name: = This is the name of your form. It will help you identify the form on forms manager page. Unique Name is not visible on the front end of your website.

= Form Description: = Administrative field to describe the form. Not visible on the front end.

= Redirection: = Option to redirect visitors to a specific page already created on your website or to a specific URL. Handy to show information related to contact or registration once the form is submitted.

= Header Text: = This is the text you want to show above your form to your site visitors.

= Auto-Responder Toggle: = Allows you to create and send an automatic message to form submitter. You can decide message subject and text. If it is off, no message will be sent.

= Success Message: = Message displayed to the user after successfully submitting the form. This is different from redirection. Success message stays for 5 seconds before redirecting the visiter. 

Once created, each form is represented by a square card that displays important information about the form at a glance and quick editing buttons. Multi-select boxes allow you to clone or delete forms with single click.

Next important step is creating custom fields for your WordPress form. Click “Fields” button on the form card you want to edit. This will take you to a new page. Available fields are displayed as red pills on the top bar. Clicking any field will take you to field parameters page. 

Once saved, the fields will appear as white horizontal bars with drag and drop handle on left, which can be used for rearranging order. You can quickly change the form using drop down menu on top right.

On Forms Manager page, submission counter is visible on each form card, clicking which takes you to submission entries for that  particular form in a tabular format. Each entry holds all the information about the submission., including fields captured during the submission.

A small gear icon takes you to Global Settings. You can enable/ disable reCaptcha and set password generation preference for registration form type here.

Each form card also displays “shortcode” required to display the forms on your site. Copy the short code and paste it inside a page, post or custom widget to display the form on your WordPress website.
